Description: Representation-dependent gene level operations of a 
        genetic algorithm with binary coded genes:
        Initialization of random binary genes, several gene maps for 
        binary genes, several mutation operators, several crossover
        operators with 1 and 2 kids, replication 
        pipelines for 1 and 2 kids, and, last but not least, function 
        factories for configuration. 
        See Goldberg, D. E. (1989, ISBN:0-201-15767-5).
